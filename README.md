# Hospitality App

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a Hospitality app for my church. The Hospitality team is a group of nearly 100 individuals (?) who assist church services on a regular basis, typically once a month for one mass.

## Today
The current system involves a hefty PDF document which contains dates and times (scheduling) for each member of the Hospitality team. As weeks approach members scheduled for the coming Sunday are emailed on a Monday/Tuesday and instructed to reply to an email thread as confirmation. It is up to the few _show runners_ to keep track of all these individuals and notify team leaders. If a member cannot make their scheduled time they must attempt to find a replacement. Typically this process involves mass spam-like emails to the entire team pleading for a replacement.

## Tomorrow

The goal of this app in a more low level setting is the following:

### Phase 1
[] Create a static website for SM Hospitality

### Phase 2
[] Add a login flow for administrators (Dan, Cathy)
[] Add all members with phone numbers and emails (_this will be hidden from google searches and bots_)
[] Use the site as a simple tracker

### Phase 3
[] Integrate website with twilio so members can be texted or emailed.
[] Send out weekly (_Thursday or Friday_) status reports for each mass.

## Thoughts
I do not like the idea of giving every user a login. The simple solution would involve member correspondence via email and text ONLY. For now if users need to edit they should contact administrators directly.
